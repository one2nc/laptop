# Laptop

## Overview

Laptop is an automated setup script for configuring macOS or Linux laptops for backend and site reliability engineering work at One2N. We expect you to run the Linux or Mac scripts in your first week of joining One2N. Various useful tools (we are opinionated) are installed as part of these scripts.

## Key Features

- **Idempotent Execution:** Can be run multiple times safely on the same machine
- **Smart Installation:** Automatically handles package installation, upgrades, or skips based on existing state
- **Logging:** Maintains detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **Customizable:** Supports local customizations through `~/.laptop.local`

## Requirements

We support:

- macOS Monterey (12.3) on Apple Silicon and Intel

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested.
Bug reports for older versions are welcome.

## Install

Download the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/one2nc/laptop/main/mac
```

Review the script (avoid running scripts you haven't read!):

```sh
less mac
```

Execute the downloaded script:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, review the log:

```sh
less ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, [install thoughtbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles#install).

## Debugging

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.

In case some package already exists (e.g. google-chrome), and the
script fails due to some error like

```
Error: It seems there is already an App at '/Applications/Google Chrome.app'.
```

use the `-f` (or `--force`) option and run that command again. In this case, run
`brew install --cask google-chrome --force`. This should reinstall Chrome properly.
Once done, you can run the main script again.

## Customize in `~/.laptop.local`

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew bundle --file=- <<EOF
brew "Caskroom/cask/dockertoolbox"
brew "go"
brew "ngrok"
brew "watch"
EOF

default_docker_machine() {
  docker-machine ls | grep -Fq "default"
}

if ! default_docker_machine; then
  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
fi

default_docker_machine_running() {
  default_docker_machine | grep -Fq "Running"
}

if ! default_docker_machine_running; then
  docker-machine start default
fi

fancy_echo "Cleaning up old Homebrew formulae ..."
brew cleanup
brew cask cleanup

if [ -r "$HOME/.rcrc" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Updating dotfiles ..."
  rcup
fi
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo` and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.

## Contributing

Edit the `mac` file.
Document in the `README.md` file.
Follow shell style guidelines by using [ShellCheck](http://www.shellcheck.net/about.html) and [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic).

```sh
brew install shellcheck
```

### Testing your changes

Test your changes by running the script on a fresh install of macOS.
You can use the free and open source emulator [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app).

Tip: Make a fresh virtual machine with the installation of macOS completed and
your user created and first launch complete. Then duplicate that machine to test
the script each time on a fresh install thats ready to go.
